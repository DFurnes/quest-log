```

Finally, enter your world and enable this module from the "Manage Modules" menu in the Settings tab.


## Usage

**Simply edit the title of a journal entry to change its appearance:** Prefix with `Main Quest:`, `Side Quest:`, or `Quest:` to add an icon to the journal entry. Optionally, suffix with `(In Progress)` or `(Complete)` to mark quest status.

**Journal entries are hidden by default:** You can change visibility by right-clicking on an entry, choosing "Configure Permission", and changing "All Players" to "Observer" (read-only access) or "Owner" (read & write access).

**Choose your favorite color:** You can pick the color of the "Main Quest" icons in the Module Settings menu.
